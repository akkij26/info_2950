Plans for going ahead: 
Phase 2: due 24 Oct
What needs to be done by then: 

ON JUPYTER NOTEBOOK:
-Introduction: What is the context of the work? What research question are you
trying to answer? What are your main findings? Include a brief summary of your
results.
-Data description: This should be inspired by the format presented in Gebru et al,
2018. Answer any relevant questions from sections 3.1-3.5 of the Gebru et al
article, especially the following questions:
=> What are the observations (rows) and the attributes (columns)?
=> Why was this dataset created?
=> Who funded the creation of the dataset?
=> What processes might have influenced what data was observed and
recorded and what was not?
=> What preprocessing was done, and how did the data come to be in the
form that you are using?
=> If people are involved, were they aware of the data collection and if so,
what purpose did they expect the data to be used for?
=> Where can your raw source data be found, if applicable? Provide a link to
the raw data (hosted in a Cornell Google Drive or Cornell Box).
-Acknowledgments 
-Appendix: Data cleaning description: Submit an updated version of your data cleaning
description from phase II that describes all data cleaning steps performed on your raw
data to turn it into the analysis-read dataset submitted with your final project. The data
cleaning description should be a separate Jupyter notebook with executed cells, and it
should output the dataset you submit as part of your project (e.g. written as a .csv file).

INDIVIDUALLY: 
- need to decide what needs to be done and who will do what over the weekend so that we 
can be finished by Monday. Also need to consider what will be done WEEKLY for rest of semester.
