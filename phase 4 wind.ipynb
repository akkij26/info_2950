    "*Our research focus/question changed drastically during the phase 2 process. We did some initial cleaning and analysis on our preliminary data, but eventually decided to refocus our attention. We had some data on renewable energy generation in the US that we were planning on using simply to contextualize our initial question, which dealt primarily with placement of windmills so as to generate the most amount of energy while also being considerate of other social, environmental, and economic factors. As we progressed in our research, however, we decided that refocusing our question would require more data on energy usage and production (and via what source), so we went looking for better datasets. While we did find better datasets eventually and we understand that this is simply part of the process, we wanted to acknowledge some of the work that did go into phase 2 but which will, more likely than not, be scrapped in the final phase of this project. As such, we keep that preliminary work in this notebook, but we are sure to note explicitely which datasets we will probably not be using in future.*"

    "The 2022 global energy crisis began shortly after the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021, which has affected quite literally everyone. We observe it everyday - increased gas prices, headlines about oil exports, etc. This crisis is not limited to the energy industry but is bound to have a domino effect on other sectors like the food sector, labor industry and all possible parts of the economy. We are staring at a global shortage which must be addressed. Moreover, the use of fossil fuels will have to hit a decline in the coming years, not only due to remaining quantity, but also because of its negative and cyclical effects upon the environment. We got interested in the energy sector mainly because of the dire effects it can have if we do not deal with its ever increasing consumption demands, but also with the deleterious consequences of no changes being made in our current energy consumption/production. We are therefore interested in understanding how well equipped we are to deal with this predicted global shortage. We also wish to propose alternatives in terms of renewable energy and in doing so plan on analyzing different energy sources to find the most optimal switch while remaining economically sound. \n",

    "\n",
    "The datasets consumption_df and production_df have been taken from  EIA annual energy review, and they detail US energy production and consumption (https://ourworldindata.org/fossil-fuels) from 1973-June 2022. The values are given in units of quadrillion BTU. The dataset itself uses different sources (BP Statistical Review of World Energy, The Shift Project (TSP), IEA – International Energy Agency, Energy Information Administration, World Development Indicators – World Bank). We looked into the data sources to find that some are either US government agencies or cooperatives of different shareholders. Most of the data collection has been to provide general information to the public and not for a particular project to get a specific result which means we are eliminating the possibility of a biased dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are using this dataset to assess the ability of US energy production sources to meet demands, in order to anticipate production and technology challenges. We plan on doing a comparative study in the growth rate of the two to predict the future shortages or trends depending on what we find in our analysis. Right now there are two different datasets but we will be combining them later on for easier analysis. From a top view, we can see that there is an increase of renewable resources over the years, but then when new methods of fossil fuel production increased, fossil fuel usage increased as well. Our goal is to further analyze the difference in these growth rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset 3 (Windmill Dataset)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset ref_df has been taken from the Geospatial Data Science datasets presented by NREL (National Renewable Energy Laboratory). The link can be found here: https://www.nrel.gov/gis/wind-supply-curves.html. The NREL falls under the U.S. Department of Energy and works as a government agency. The purpose of this data collection was to provide general information to the public and create visualizations to understand Geospatial Data and how it varies from place to place. Since this data was not for any particular study, we are eliminating the possibility of a biased dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Reason why we are using wind energy:* After graphing the total renewable energy production graph we can notice that there is an upward trend in most of the renewable energy sources except for Hydroelectric Power Production. On looking closely, we can notice that by the end of 2022, the wind energy production curve had the steepest slope with one of the largest contributions. Therefore, we decided to focus on harnessing this energy resource to find an optimal solution for the future energy requirements.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset provides us with a potential list of areas for windmill placements. The columns include the coordinates of the places (longitude and latitude), the area of the location (area_sq_km), energy generation capabilities (capacity_mw, generation_mwh, capacity_factor), wind speed (wind_speed_120meters), and some information about potentially storing the energy generated (distance_to_transmission_km). We did some initial mappings to find that while the dataset gives us a lot of locations (for context, the dataset initially contained 300,000 rows), not all are practically usable. We plan on considering other factors such as biodiversity considerations, size restrictions for economically sound wind farms, organizational measures, etc to narrow down this list. Our goal is to find the energy demand gap by using the dataset consumption_df and production_df and find the most optimal locations for the windmill placements to fulfill this gap. \n",

We plot total renewable energy production over time, and we plot the curves for different energy source production as well to show an initial visualization how much of that renewable energy production comes form each type. We see that wind has the steepest curve as of late. We also plot simply the rise in total fossil fuels production alone over the years. "

These will give us a good idea of where the most amount of energy generation would take place given that capacity_factor is electrical energy generated per unit capacity.
