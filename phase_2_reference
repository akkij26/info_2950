Ideas:
might be intersting to have a plot showing the increase of wind generated power versus fossil fuel generated power in US over past 2 decades (IRENA datasets can be 
used to do this).

First, include a cheat sheet for all the files that have been added to this repository, at least for phase 2, and what information those files contain. 

*wtk_site_metadata.csv 
This file is a bit difficult to parse, but basically there are given longitudes and latitudes with associated fraction_of_usable area, capacity, wind speed etc. 
This file contains about 300,000 rows, but it also has data on offshore windmills/areas. This is the first thing I found, though I am not entirely sure it is usable. 
Perhaps we could do a join with the other datasets...

*Reference_Access_Siting_Regime_ATB_Mid_Turbine_csv
This file includes a bunch more information on generation, area in square meters (that I am guessing is usable area?), wind_speed at 120 meters, etc. This is
only considering on-shore data. This could help in terms of visualizing some of those other factors we might be considering. 
From the paper detailing reference access (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544221002930?via%3Dihub#bib46):
"Reference Access is a regime that balances siting considerations and is informed by common practices to guide development. For example, a 25% slope restriction 
is used to prevent erosion in addition to other physical restrictions that are assumed under the Open Access scenario. The Reference Access scenario also 
applies 7 documented state and 271 county setback and height restrictions. For regions without setback requirements, we apply a typical county ordinance minimum 
setback of 1.1x the maximum turbine tip height from infrastructure for safety reasons. We also assume buffered setbacks from radar stations (4 km and 9 km for 
NEXRAD and SRR/LRR respectively)."
Basically, this file only lists potential sites that meet certain requirements. They have narrowed the list for us already though... 

Other notes on this dataset: 
-generation is divided by the mean reported capacity factor to estimate capacity.
-Although larger turbines result in lower capacity potential because of increased setback distances, they also can produce more electrical energy per unit of capacity
(i.e., they have higher capacity factors).
- The available capacity in each site can be reduced by excluded land area, and each site captures the unique techno-economic characteristics as driven by the wind
resource and distance to transmission.
-distance to transmission/distance to urban areas??
- Those authors also used global GIS data to estimate the technical energy potential of wind resources with capacity factors above 20% (equivalent to a supply cost
threshold of 12 US cents/kWh based on assumptions with medium values of parameters as used in this study) but neglected land suitability factors and the costs of 
technology.

*wind_potential_80m_110m_140m_35percent.xlsx
This file contains wind capacity potential for different states. Thing I like about this file is it has alot more context and information about what it is describing.

*fossil-fuel-consumption-by-type.csv 
features data on type of fossil fuels used and how much for each year for each country... found here: https://ourworldindata.org/fossil-fuels


*Table_10.1)....xlsx
shows two different tables on energy production and consumption in US from renewable energy sources

*Table_1.2....xlsx
shows primary energy production by source 

*Table_1.3....xlsx
shows primary energy consumption by source

Second, here we list the important factors worth considering in onshore windmill placement in the US:
The main inputs to the model include wind speed, elevation, slope, land cover, protected areas, and parameters related to wind turbine technology performance and cost.
We can add some parameters perhaps to make our own considerations more robust... basically adding on to existing research...maybe we could even do a rank?
1. wind speed 
2. 



Concerns: 
-Are we just visualizing people's data and not really doing our own thing you know? To combat this, how could we possibly join different datasets? Need to ask minmo/TAs
about how best to ensure we are doing enough cleaning/scraping...
