Phase 3: Preregistration of Analyses

In Phase 3, we outline 2 different analyses that we will include in the final report, no matter the significance of said analyses. 

Analysis 1: 
We will fit a logistic regression model on the total renewable production/consumption given the input of time. We want to predict the next 30 years of 
renewable energy production/consumption. We can do a test/train split on the data to see whether the model is working well or overfitting and then 
evaluating metrics such as RMSE and MAE.  We will also make some bootstrapping samples (dependent on size of our cleaned dataset) and train our model 
on each of said samples to learn more about the model and see what it tells us about our distributions. 


Analysis 2: 
Our dataset ref_df contains values for different characteristics that go into determining windmill placement. We will rank certain values of each 
characteristic given in our ref_df (ie create a dictionary similar to what we did in hw5 to assign different ranges of a characteristic to a numerical 
value. Then we will run a multiple regression on these characteristics.
